Url Shortener

Assumptions:

You have already installed node, npm, yarn, docker and make.

How to Run Tests:

If you would like to run tests, first run "make setup" to install dependencies then run "make test" to run both the ui and api test suites.

How to Start the App:

To start the application, simply run "make server". There's no need to run "make setup" as the docker-compose file takes care of setup.

Web URL: http://localhost:5000
API URL: http://localhost:9000

How to Use:

On the home page (http://localhost:5000), you can paste any valid address into the text field. You can then submit by either pressing Enter or clicking "Shorten URL." This will return a shortened URL within a short amount of time.

You can either click the url to open it in a new window, or copy it using the "Copy" button. If you'd like to shorten another URL, just click "Back to Home."

Notes:
The tests for the api are run on the same port as the server for the integration tests, so if you want to run tests, just make sure you run the tests before running the server.

Ways to Improve:
Currently there's no mechanism to retry submission if the off chance a random slug is reproduced when saving a url. Would need to implement a try/catch to retry generating a random slug.
